## OOP Principles Used
1. Encapsulation
Classes such as Restaurant and UserProfile encapsulate data and its manipulation, exposing only the necessary information through their public methods.
2. Abstraction
Interfaces like TripAdvisorService and YelpService abstract the details of HTTP requests and responses, providing a clear API for data retrieval.
3. Inheritance
By extending from base classes such as Fragment and ViewModel, specialized behaviors are enabled (e.g., HomeFragment, HomeFragmentViewModel) while reusing common functionality.
4. Polymorphism
Overridden methods within Activities, Fragments, and ViewModels allow for polymorphic behavior that is tailored to specific needs.
